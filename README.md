# Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language



***WARNING: The data, lexicons, and notebooks all contain content that is racist, sexist, homophobic, and offensive in many other ways.***

You can find the labeled data in the `data` directory which is included as a pickle file (Python 2.7) and as a CSV. You will also find a notebook in the `src` directory containing Python 2.7 code to replicate the analyses  and a lexicon in the `lexicons` directory that is generated to try to more accurately classify hate speech. The `classifier` directory contains a script, instructions, and the necessary files to run the classifier on new data, a test case is provided.
